   <h2>Summary</h2>
      <h3>I am an academic-turned-web developer from Harlem, GA. </h3>
      <h3>My academic interests gathered around the fields of psychology and sociology in particular which have given me a broadened perspective of the human experience, and these academic experiences bolstered my love of learning.</h3>
      <h3>I found theClubhou.se after graduating from college, which allowed me to professionalize my interests in both web and business development, as well as offered an opportunity for me to integrate my psychological background in technical skills.</h3>
      <h3>I am interested in a web development job that is both challenging and rewarding. I want to be charged with learning new skills, as well as developing skills I already possess.</h3>
