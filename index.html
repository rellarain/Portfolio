   <h2>Summary</h2>
      <h3>I am an <span class="orange">academic</span>-turned-<span class="wine">web developer</span> from <span class="coral">Harlem, GA.</span></h3>
      <h3>My academic interests gathered around the fields of <span class="wine">psychology</span> and <span class="purple">sociology</span> in particular which have given me a <span class="orange">broadened perspective of the human experience</span>, and these academic experiences bolstered my <span class="coral">love of learning</span>.</h3>
      <h3>I found <span class="purple">theClubhou.se</span> after <span class="wine">graduating from college</span>, which allowed me to <span class="coral">professionalize my interests</span> in both <span class="purple">web design</span> and <span class="orange">business development</span>, as well as offered an opportunity for me to <span class="wine">integrate my psychological background</span> into <span class="orange">marketable, technical</span> skills.</h3>
      <h3>I am interested in a web development position that is both <span class="coral">challenging</span> and <span class="purple">rewarding</span>. I want to be tasked with <span class="orange">learning new skills</span>, as well as <span class="wine">developing skills</span> I already possess.</h3>
